### Prioritization Levels

| Level  | Abbr | Rationale |
|--------| -----|-----------|
|High    | H    |&bull;  Must do.<br>&bull; The trip would be a disappointment if missed.|
|        | M/H  | |
|Medium  | M    |&bull; You would like to do it.<br>&bull; Not a disaster if missed.|
|        | L/M  | |
|Low     | L    |&bull; You'd wouldn't mind doing it, but not over higher priorities.<br>&bull; You would definitely do it if the whole family is.<br>&bull; You would take one of the kids on it.<br>&bull; Would do it just to be a completionist.|
|Skip    | S    |&bull; Do NOT want to do it<br>&bull; Would rather wait outside if every is doing it.|
